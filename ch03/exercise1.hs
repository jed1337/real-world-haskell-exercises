-- 1. Write the converse of fromList for the List type: a function that takes a List a and generates a [a].
toList Nil = []
toList (Cons a b) = a : toList b

-- 2. Define a tree type that has only one constructor, like our Java example. Instead of the Empty constructor, use the Maybe type to refer to a nodeâ€™s children.
